I've heard about the concept of rubber duck debugging, where programmers talk through their code problems to an inanimate object, like a rubber duck, to help them find solutions.  

How exactly does this method work, and why is it effective?  

Can someone share best practices or personal experiences with using rubber duck debugging to improve problem-solving skills and overall programming ability? Any tips on how to effectively 'talk' to the rubber duck would be greatly appreciated!
