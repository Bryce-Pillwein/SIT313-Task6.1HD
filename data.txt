Embarking on your journey into web development begins with learning HTML, the foundational language that structures web pages. HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to create the skeleton of a webpage. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you understand the basics of HTML development.

#### Understanding HTML Structure

At its core, HTML consists of a series of elements, represented by tags, that define the content and structure of a webpage. Each HTML document starts with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>` element which encompasses the entire content of the page. Inside the `<html>` element, you'll typically find two main sections: `<head>` and `<body>`.

-   **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML.
-   **`<html>`**: The root element of an HTML page.
-   **`<head>`**: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, character set, and links to stylesheets.
-   **`<body>`**: Contains the actual content of the webpage that is visible to users.

#### Basic HTML Tags

Here are some of the most commonly used HTML tags that form the building blocks of web development:

-   **`<h1> to <h6>`**: Header tags, with `<h1>` being the highest (or most important) level and `<h6>` the lowest.
-   **`<p>`**: Paragraph tag, used to define blocks of text.
-   **`<a>`**: Anchor tag, used to create hyperlinks. It requires an `href` attribute to specify the URL.
-   **`<img>`**: Image tag, used to embed images. It requires a `src` attribute to specify the image source and an `alt` attribute for alternative text.
-   **`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`**: Used to create lists. `<ul>` is for unordered lists (bulleted), `<ol>` is for ordered lists (numbered), and `<li>` defines list items.
-   **`<div>` and `<span>`**: Generic containers for grouping and styling purposes. `<div>` is a block-level element, while `<span>` is an inline element.
-   **`<form>`**: Used to create forms for user input. It can contain various form elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`, and `<select>`.
